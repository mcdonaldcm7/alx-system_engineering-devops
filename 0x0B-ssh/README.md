**DevOps** **SSH** **Network** **SysAdmin** **Security**

## About
This project introduces SSH, What it is, How it works, How it used, Why it is used, and so on ...
SSH (Secure Shell) is a communication protocol (like http, https, ftp, etc)
used as the primary means of connecting to Linux servers remotely. It provides a
text-based interface by spawning a remote shell.
 After connecting, all commands you type in your local terminal are sent to the remote servers and executed there.
