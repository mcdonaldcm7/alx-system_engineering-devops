# Project - 0x0D Web stack debugging #0

## About
This project is part of a web debugging series that is designed to help develop
debugging skills. In this series we (ALX-Students) are given broken/bugged webstacks and the final goal is to come up with a Bash script that once executed, will
bring the webstack to a working state.
