The root of all tree is it's life force,
without it the tree has no means of gaining nutrients,
root are the describing foundation of every society,
work on your foundation so that you may withstand the storm ahead.
other talks on the foundation and so on continues,
I want to conclude this passage by telling you the truth that most people ignore,
the foundation unseen is the most important part,
of a building that is seen.
