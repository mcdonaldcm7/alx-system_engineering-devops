The world goes up and down, but we don't feel it because of gravity,
The sun is very hot but we don't feel it because of the distance,
There are always threats around us but we don't need to get overwhelmed,
We have knives in kitchen but we don't fear them, ... Yet
until they're in the hands of a killer.
