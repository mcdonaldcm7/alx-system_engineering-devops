**DevOps** **SysAdmin**

## About
This is a system engineering devops project and the primary goal of the project
is to setup a second server to have identical configuration with the first, and
also add a custom header to the HTTP response, reason being because a load
balancner(Nginx) will be placed to efficiently distribute requests from the client
between the two servers which brings about the last agenda for the project **Install and setup a load balancer**
